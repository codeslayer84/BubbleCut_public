# Bubblecut — downloads

A desktop editor for 360° (equirectangular) video, built for research
recordings rather than for broadcast, with one-click export that plays
correctly in VR headsets and on YouTube/Vimeo 360.

**This repository holds released builds only.** The source is not currently
public.

## Download

Grab the latest from [Releases](../../releases).

- **macOS (Apple silicon):** `Bubblecut_*_aarch64.dmg`
- **Windows:** `Bubblecut_*_x64-setup.exe`, or the `.msi`

## FFmpeg is required and is not bundled

Bubblecut shells out to FFmpeg for every decode and encode. Install it first:

- macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
- Windows: `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`

The app checks on startup and shows the right command if it cannot find it.

On Apple silicon, make sure it is a native arm64 build. An Intel FFmpeg under
Rosetta cannot reach the hardware video encoder and exports roughly 20× slower
— measured at 0.16× realtime against 3.76× for the native build.

## First launch on macOS

The build is signed but not notarised, so macOS blocks it the first time with
"Apple could not verify Bubblecut is free of malware".

**System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → scroll to the message about
Bubblecut → **Open Anyway**.

Or from a terminal:

```
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Bubblecut.app
```

Control-clicking and choosing Open no longer works — Apple removed that bypass
for unnotarised apps in macOS 15.

## Citing
